// node seems designed as a server/client model. It features an infinite loop with a select statement that waits to
// receive a message from a number of channels, each channel represents an operation.
// When the node is stopped, via a message in chan stop, the channel done is closed and the loop terminates

// The deadlock occurs when the node is stopped, and another goroutine calls the node.Status() function.
// The Status() will try sending a message to the channel status, requesting the status info from the node.
// Since the node has stopped, the infinite loop has also stopped, and the send on channel status will never complete.
// The fix is to add a select statement, with the send to the status channel and a receive on done channel.
// If the node is stopped, the done channel will be closed and the select will choose the case with the done channel.
