// The deadlock in the test unit that test the progress tracking of downloads/uploads
//
// The progress tracking features a Progress channel masterProgressChan from where it receives updates, and
// Watchers that receive updates via another channel.
// The test unit checks that progress updates in the correct sequence, from 0 to 10, ensuring that it starts with 0 and
// ends with 10.
// The bug occurs because the unit test checked if all updates incremented by 1, and terminated the
// watchers are not guaranteed to receive all updates, consecutive updates might be condensed
// into a single one (the last update of the set).
